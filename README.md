# Raw Audio Processing with Machine Learning Models

In this project, we explore various machine learning models suitable for raw audio processing.

## Dataset
Our dataset comprises recordings of three caller types of elephants:
- Rumble
- Roar
- Trumpet

## Used Models
We experimented with the following models:

1. **MobileNet V2:**
   - Utilized pre-trained data and fine-tuned it on our dataset.

2. **YAMNet:**
   - Trained the model from scratch specifically for our datasets.

3. **RawNet:**
   - Trained the model from scratch for our datasets.

4. **ElephantCallerNet based from ACDNet:**
   - Trained the model from scratch for our datasets.
  
## Pre-processing
The models are trained on raw audio files. However, the audio files need to be pre-processed before training. Here are the steps for pre-processing:
